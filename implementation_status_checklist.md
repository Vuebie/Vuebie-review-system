## Notable Missing Features

Based on the implementation analysis, the following key areas require attention before final delivery:

1. **Super Admin Portal**: This module is largely not implemented. Consider prioritizing:
   - Admin dashboard for managing merchants
   - User role management interface
   - Global settings configuration

2. **Campaign Management**: While basic functionality exists through QR codes and templates, a dedicated campaign management interface would enhance merchant capabilities.
