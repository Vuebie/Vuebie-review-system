## 2. Technical Specifications

### 2.3 UI Design Draft

Below is a conceptual representation of how documentation should be updated:

#### Before (AIvue Documentation Header):
```
# AIvue Developer Documentation

Welcome to AIvue, the AI-powered video analysis platform. This documentation will guide you through using AIvue's features and APIs.

## Getting Started with AIvue
To begin using AIvue, you'll need to create an AIvue account and obtain your API credentials.
```

#### After (Vuebie Documentation Header):
```
# Vuebie Developer Documentation

Welcome to Vuebie, the AI-powered video analysis platform. This documentation will guide you through using Vuebie's features and APIs.

## Getting Started with Vuebie
To begin using Vuebie, you'll need to create a Vuebie account and obtain your API credentials.
```

For API documentation:

#### Before:
```javascript
// Initialize AIvue client
const aivue = new AIvue({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key',
  projectId: 'your_project_id'
});

// AIvue API request
const response = await aivue.analyze({
  videoUrl: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
  options: {
    enableAIvueFaceDetection: true
  }
});
```

#### After:
```javascript
// Initialize Vuebie client
const vuebie = new Vuebie({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key',
  projectId: 'your_project_id'
});

// Vuebie API request
const response = await vuebie.analyze({
  videoUrl: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
  options: {
    enableVuebieFaceDetection: true
  }
});
```

### 2.4 Open Questions

1. Should we implement a phased approach to documentation updates or update all documentation simultaneously?
2. Are there any specific SEO considerations for maintaining search rankings during the transition?
3. Will API endpoints change as part of this rebranding? If so, how will backward compatibility be maintained?
4. How should we communicate the rebranding to users who access the documentation frequently?
5. Are there any legal requirements or trademark considerations for updating documentation?
6. Should we maintain any references to the previous brand name for clarity during the transition period?
7. How will the rebranding affect documentation translation and localization processes?
8. What metrics should we use to measure the success of the documentation rebranding effort?
