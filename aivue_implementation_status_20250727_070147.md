## Notable Missing Features

Based on the implementation analysis, the following key areas require attention before final delivery:

1. **Super Admin Portal**: This module is largely not implemented. Consider prioritizing:
   - Admin dashboard for managing merchants
   - User role management interface
   - Global settings configuration

2. **Campaign Management**: While basic functionality exists through QR codes and templates, a dedicated campaign management interface would enhance merchant capabilities.

## Recommendations

1. Prioritize the implementation of the Super Admin Portal to enable platform governance.
2. Consider enhancing the Campaign Management features for better marketing capabilities.
3. Ensure comprehensive testing of the internationalization features across all interfaces.
4. Document the API endpoints and edge functions for future maintainability.
