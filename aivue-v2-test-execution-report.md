## 6. Detailed Issue Analysis

### 6.1 Critical Issues

#### Issue #1: Multi-level Role Inheritance Failure
- **Description:** When roles are nested more than two levels deep, permissions are not properly inherited by lower-level roles
- **Impact:** Could lead to unintended access restrictions or permissions
- **Reproduction Steps:** 
  1. Create a top-level role with specific permissions
  2. Create a second-level role inheriting from the first
  3. Create a third-level role inheriting from the second
  4. Verify permissions on the third level
- **Recommendation:** Redesign role inheritance algorithm to handle arbitrary depth of inheritance

### 6.2 Major Issues

#### Issue #2: Notification Delivery to Suspended Merchants
- **Description:** Suspended merchant accounts continue to receive automated system notifications
- **Impact:** Creates confusion and potentially allows suspended merchants to continue operations
- **Recommendation:** Add merchant status check to notification delivery pipeline

#### Issue #3: SMS Notification Delays Under Load
- **Description:** SMS notifications experience significant delays (>5 minutes) when system is under high load
- **Impact:** Time-sensitive notifications may arrive too late to be actionable
- **Recommendation:** Implement queue prioritization for SMS messages or increase SMS gateway capacity

#### Issue #4: Fraud Detection Bypass Via Incognito Mode
- **Description:** The fraud detection system fails to identify multiple submissions from the same device when using incognito browsing
- **Impact:** Potential for incentive fraud and review manipulation
- **Recommendation:** Implement additional device fingerprinting methods that work across browsing modes

### 6.3 Minor Issues

#### Issue #5: Incomplete Vietnamese Translations
- **Description:** Vietnamese language translations incomplete for settings menu (~85% complete)
- **Impact:** Some settings pages display English text for Vietnamese users
- **Recommendation:** Complete translation of remaining settings menu items

#### Issue #6: CSV Export Headers Missing
- **Description:** CSV exports missing column headers when exporting large datasets (>10,000 rows)
- **Impact:** Reduced usability of exported data
- **Recommendation:** Fix CSV export handler to ensure headers are always included

## 7. UI/UX Observations

### 7.1 Positive Findings
- Dashboard layouts are intuitive and well-organized
- Consistent design language throughout the application
- Responsive design works well across tested devices
- Clear feedback for user actions
- Helpful tooltips and guidance for complex features

### 7.2 Improvement Opportunities
- Global navigation could be streamlined (currently requires 3-4 clicks to navigate between major sections)
- Campaign comparison tool would benefit from side-by-side view rather than tabbed interface
- Data visualization color schemes could be improved for accessibility
- Mobile views of analytics dashboards require excessive scrolling

## 8. Recommendations

1. Fix multi-level role inheritance issue in User Role Management System
2. Resolve notification delivery to suspended merchant accounts
3. Address fraud detection bypass via incognito browsing

### 8.2 High Priority Items (Should address before production)
1. Optimize SMS notification delivery under high load conditions
2. Complete Vietnamese language translations for settings menu
3. Fix CSV export header issue for large datasets
