# Vuebie Test Plan

## Overview
This comprehensive test plan outlines the testing strategy for the Vuebie platform following the rebranding from AIvue. It describes the testing approach, test environments, types of testing, and criteria for success to ensure that the platform meets quality standards before release.

## Test Strategy

### 1. Testing Objectives

- Verify that all rebranded elements are correctly implemented
- Ensure all functionality works as expected after rebranding
- Validate that the user experience remains intuitive and consistent
- Confirm that performance metrics meet or exceed previous benchmarks
- Verify compatibility across supported browsers, devices, and integrations

### 2. Testing Scope

#### In Scope
- User interface rebranding verification
- Core platform functionality testing
- API functionality and documentation
- Performance testing of critical user paths
- Cross-browser and responsive design testing
- Security verification for authentication and data protection
- Documentation and help content verification

#### Out of Scope
- Extensive load testing (covered in separate performance test plan)
- Penetration testing (scheduled as separate security assessment)
- Long-term reliability testing (covered by monitoring after release)

### 3. Testing Approach

- **Phased Testing**: Testing will be conducted in phases, starting with unit testing, followed by integration, system, and user acceptance testing
- **Automated Testing**: Automated test suites will be used for regression testing and repeated test scenarios
- **Manual Testing**: Exploratory and usability testing will be performed manually to identify edge cases and UX issues
- **A/B Testing**: Selected features will undergo A/B testing with a small percentage of users before full rollout

## Test Environments

### 1. Development Environment
