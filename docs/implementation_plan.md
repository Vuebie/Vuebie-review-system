- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and design system
- **SWR**: For data fetching and caching
- **Zustand**: For state management
- **React Query**: For server state management

```

### Backend Services

Vuebie uses a combination of backend services:

1. **API Service**: Next.js API routes for handling requests
2. **Video Processing Service**: Serverless functions for video processing
3. **Analysis Service**: Container-based service for AI analysis
4. **Notification Service**: Event-driven service for notifications
5. **Reporting Service**: On-demand service for report generation

#### API Structure

```
api/
├── organizations/       # Organization management
├── projects/            # Project management
├── videos/              # Video upload and management
├── analysis/            # Analysis job management
├── users/               # User management
└── reports/             # Report generation
```

### Database Schema

See [Data Model](data_model.md) for detailed database schema information.

### Video Processing Pipeline

The video processing pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Upload**: User uploads video to temporary storage
2. **Validation**: Service validates video format and content
3. **Transcoding**: Video is transcoded to standard formats
4. **Thumbnail Generation**: Thumbnails are extracted at regular intervals
5. **Metadata Extraction**: Basic metadata is extracted (duration, resolution, etc.)
6. **Storage**: Processed video and assets are stored in permanent storage
7. **Indexing**: Video information is indexed for search and retrieval

### Analysis Pipeline

The video analysis pipeline includes:

1. **Job Creation**: User requests analysis with specific parameters
2. **Queuing**: Analysis job is queued for processing
3. **Processing**: Video is analyzed using specified models
4. **Result Storage**: Analysis results are stored in database
5. **Notification**: User is notified of completed analysis
6. **Indexing**: Analysis results are indexed for search and filtering
