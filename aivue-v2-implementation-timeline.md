## Resource Allocation

- **Backend Developer (1)**: Role permissions, notification system, database optimizations
- **Frontend Developer (1)**: CSV exports, Vietnamese translations, UI testing
- **DevOps Engineer (0.5)**: Redis setup, queue implementation, performance monitoring
- **QA Engineer (1)**: Testing execution, regression testing, load testing
- **Product Manager (0.25)**: Stakeholder coordination, sign-off management

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Delayed resolution of critical permission issue | Allocate additional developer resources if needed |
| Performance improvements below target | Prepare additional optimization strategies as backup |
| Stakeholder delays in review/approval | Schedule review sessions in advance with clear agenda |
| Unexpected issues during production deployment | Comprehensive testing in staging and detailed rollback plan |
| Resource contention with other projects | Clear communication with management about resource needs and priority |

## Communication Plan

- Daily standup meetings to track progress (15 minutes)
- Issue tracking in project management system with daily updates
- Weekly status report to stakeholders on progress and blockers
- Pre-deployment review meeting with all team members
- Post-deployment retrospective to document lessons learned
